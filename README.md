# Traveling Salesman Problem
This repository contains the implementation of three versions of the Traveling Salesman Problem, an exact one and two approximative versions. 
Through tests, experiments and performance analysis, this project dives into this classic NP-Complete problem and the tradeoffs between 
approximative and exact algorithms.

The implemented versions were:
- Branch and Bound (Exact)
- Twice Around the Tree (Approximative)
- Christofides (Approximative)

The documentation provides comprehensive analyses of the problem and the implemented solution, covering various aspects such as the algorithms' descriptions, 
algorithmic complexities, and performance evaluations.
